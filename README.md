# Crypto Quizzes Tapp

## Concept Overview

**Objective:** Create an interactive quiz Tapp that allows crypto projects to engage users by offering rewards for correct answers, incentivizing sharing, and promoting their contentâ€”all within the Twitter platform using Tlink.

### Key Features:

- **Crypto Project Participation:** A crypto project provides $100 USD worth of their tokens as a reward for a quiz.
- **Account NFT Tapp:** Users can utilize an account NFT Tapp (which can run in TokenScript view and doesn't have to be on Twitter) to:
  - Input a Question: The quiz question related to the project.
  - Provide Answers: Possible answers, which can be found in the project's tweet feed.
  - Specify Project Twitter Account: Link to the official project Twitter handle.
- **TLink Generation:** The Tapp generates a Tlink URL that can be shared on Twitter.
- **TokenScript Card Rendering on Twitter:** When the Tlink is shared on Twitter, the TokenScript card displayed will have three interactive buttons:
  1. Answer: Users can attempt to answer the quiz question.
  2. Share to Earn: Users can share the Tlink to earn tapp tokens or a meme coin.
  3. Leaderboard: Users can view rankings based on earnings, questions answered, and questions shared.
- **User Incentives:**
  - Rewards for Correct Answers: Users receive a portion of the $100 token reward.
  - Account NFT Tapp Access: Users earn an account NFT Tapp, enabling them to create and share their own quizzes.
- **Leaderboards:** Track and display top users based on:
  - Earnings
  - Number of questions answered correctly
  - Number of times questions are shared
- **Twitter Bot Integration:** A Twitter bot aggregates all quiz Tlinks under one account, making it easy for users to find and participate in multiple quizzes.

## Detailed Workflow

### 1. Crypto Project Sets Up the Quiz

- **Using the Account NFT Tapp:**
  - The crypto project inputs a quiz question relevant to their project.
  - Provides multiple-choice answers that can be found within their tweet feed, encouraging users to explore their content.
  - Specifies their official Twitter account to link the quiz properly.
- **TLink Generation:**
  - The Tapp generates a unique Tlink URL that encapsulates the quiz parameters.
- **Sharing on Twitter:**
  - The project shares the Tlink in a tweet, inviting followers to participate.

### 2. TokenScript Card Rendering on Twitter

- When users with the Tlink extension view the tweet, the Tlink triggers the TokenScript card to render directly within the Twitter feed.
- **Interactive Buttons:**
  1. Answer:
     - Users click to submit their answer to the quiz question.
     - Correct answers earn them a share of the token reward.
  2. Share to Earn:
     - Users can share the Tlink on their own Twitter feed.
     - Each share earns them tapp tokens or a meme coin.
     - Sharing increases the reach of the quiz, promoting virality.
  3. Leaderboard:
     - Displays rankings for top earners, most questions answered, and most shares.
     - Adds a competitive element to encourage more participation.

### 3. User Participation and Incentives
